# Multi-Cloud-Resource-Allocation-using-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Cloud-Management-Broker-CMB
This project implements an intelligent resource allocator for a Cloud Management Broker (CMB) using Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques. 
The system dynamically distributes tasks across three cloud providers, optimizing resource utilization and minimizing operational costs.
# Key Features
Dynamic Resource Allocation: Balances task distribution across providers based on resource availability and task demands.
Task Constraints: Handles specific constraints, such as Task Type 2 being unsupported by Cloud Provider 2.
Reward Optimization: Maximizes rewards by successfully executing tasks while minimizing costs.
Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: Markov Decision Process (MDP) for initial implementation. Q-Learning for iterative optimization.
Integrated Markov Decision Process (MDP) for the first milestone and Q-Learning for the second milestone.
